# Matrix-Multiplication
Matrix Multiplication 

Need do:
1) Read multiple matrixes from a file
2) Output the matrix multiplication result 

Explanation of each line in sample.txt:

2 <- number of matrixes

2 2 <- row/column of first matrix

1 2 <- item values

3 4 <- item values

2 3 <- row/column of second matrix

1 2 3 <- item values

4 5 6 <- item values

For the sample, the matrix mulitplication output is

     9    12    15
    19    26    33


#The row/column of each matrix is less than 15
#Use argv for your input file, 
*Your Program will be run with a test data file, there can be more than 2 matrixes in the file


Additional tasks
If there is a matrix say A whose row is equal to its column, output square of A which is A*A.
#For the sample, the output is

     7    10
    15    22
